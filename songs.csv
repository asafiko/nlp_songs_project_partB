start we used to mix henn' with bacardi dark and when it kicks in you can hardly talk  and by the sixth gin you gon' probably crawl and you'll be sick then and you'll probably barf and my prediction is that you gon' probably fall either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall  and everything's spinning  you're beginning to think women are swimming in pink linen again in the sink then in a couple of minutes that bottle of guinness is finished you are now allowed to officially slap bitches  you have the right to remain violent and start wildin' start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyeing you get in the car and start it and start driving over the island and cause a 42 car pileup   earth calling  pilot to co pilot looking for life on this planet sir  no sign of it all i can see is a bunch of smoke flying and i'm so high that i might die if i go by it  let me out of this place i'm outta place i'm in in outer space  i've just vanished without a trace i'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow i'll be back in an hour or so    'cause every time i go to try to leave  whoa  something keeps pulling on my sleeve  whoa  i don't wanna but i gotta stay  whoa  these drugs really gotta hold of me  whoa   'cause every time i try to tell 'em no  no  they won't let me ever let 'em go  go  i'm a sucker  all i gotta say  whoa  drugs really gotta hold of me  whoa   in third grade all i used to do was sniff glue through a tube and play rubik's cube seventeen years later i'm as rude as jude scheming on the first chick with the hugest boobs  i got no game and every face looks the same they got no name  so i don't need game to play i just say whatever i want to whoever i want whenever i want  wherever i want  however i want  however i do show some respect to few

in the morning like  yo what the fuck we do  i gotta go bitch  you know i got stuff to do 'cause if i get caught cheating then i'm stuck with you   but in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later but fuck it i'm on one  so let's enjoy let the x destroy your spinal cord so it's not a straight line no more  so we walk around looking like some wind up dolls shit sticking out of our backs like a dinosaur shit  six hits won't even get me high no more so bye for now  i'm gonna try to find some more  'cause every time i go to try to leave  whoa  something keeps pulling on my sleeve  whoa  i don't wanna but i gotta stay  whoa  these drugs really gotta hold of me  whoa   'cause every time i try to tell 'em no  no  they won't let me ever let 'em go  go  i'm a sucker  all i gotta say  whoa  these drugs really gotta hold of me  whoa   that's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow when you swallow it all  wallow and drown in your sorrow and tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again what's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend  screw it  and what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning  and what's a little fight  tomorrow you'll be boys again it's your life  live it however you wanna marijuana is everywhere  where was you brought up   it don't matter as long as you get where you're going 'cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're going they

lives with his mom he don't got a job cause bob sits at home and smokes pot but his 12 year old brother looks up to him an awful lot  and bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog drag 'em in the woods and goes straight to the chopping block  and even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be just so afraid they'd drop the charge till one night mrs  stacy went off the job when she felt someone grab hold of her face and said not to talk  but stacy knew it was bob and said knock it off but bob wouldn't knock it off 'cause he's crazy and off his rocker crazy good as slim shady is off the block  uh you couldn't even take him to dre's to give bob a doctor  grabbed stacy by the legs and chopped them off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her but ever since the day stacy went off to wander they never found her and bob still hangs at the waffle diner  and that's the story of bob and his marijuana and what it might do to you so see if the squirrels want it  it's bad for you  mr  mackey impersonation  eminem   see children  drugs are bad  come on  and if you don't believe me ask your dad  raise your hand  and if you don't believe him ask your mom  that's right  she'll tell you how she does him all the time  she will   so

barfin'  and everyone in the apartment starts laughin' at him  hey adam  zach is a jackass  look at him   'cause they took it too  so they think it's funny so they're laughing at basically nothing  except maybe wasting their money  meanwhile zach's in a coma  the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicing yoga and that's the story of zach  the ecstasy maniac so

manure  they pick it out wipe if off bag it up and you put it right in your mouth and chew it  yum yum   and then you start to see some dumb stuff and everything slows down when you eat some of 'em and sometimes you see things that aren't there  like what   like fat women in g strings with orange hair   mr  shady  what's a g string    it's yarn clair women stick them up their behinds  go out and wear 'em and if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms whoops did i say magic mushrooms  i meant fungus  your tongue gets  all swole up like a cow's tongue  how come   'cause it comes from a cow's dung see drugs are bad  it's a common fact but your mom and dad  know that's all that i'm good at  but don't be me  'cause if you grow up and go and od they're gonna come for me  and i'ma have

566,Bad Guy,it's like i'm in this dirt digging up old hurt tried everything to get my mind off you  it won't work all it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off  and left me so burnt  spent a lot of time trying to soul search maybe i needed to grow up a little first well  looks like i hit a growth spurt but i'm coming for closure don't suppose an explanation i'm owed for  the way that you turned your back on me just when i may have needed you most oh  you thought it was over you could just close the chapter and go about your life  like it was nothing you ruined mine  but you seem to be doing fine well  i've never recovered but tonight betcha that whatcha 'bout to go through's tougher than anything i ever have suffered can't think of a better way to define poetic justice can i hold grudges  mind saying  let it go  fuck this  heart's saying  i will once i bury this bitch alive  hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset   i flee the scene  like it was my last ride you see right through  oh  you had me pegged the first time you can see the truth  but it's easier to justify what's bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy i just hate to be the bad guy follow me i run  i run  follow me  follow me i just hate to be the bad guy  and to think i used to think you was the shit  bitch to think it was you at one time i worshiped  shit think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it  not this time  you better go and get sewing kit  bitch  finish this stitch  so you can reap what you sew  knit wit thought some time would pass and i'd forget it  forget it you left our family in shambles and you expect me to just get over him  pretend he never existed   maybe gone  but he's not forgotten and don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that i've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya you're wrong and that shit was rotten and the way you played him's same shit you did to me  cold have you any idea the shit that i've gone through   feelings i harbor  all this pent up resentment i hold on to not once you call to ask me how i'm doing letters  you don't respond to 'em fuck it  i'm coming to see you and gee  who better to talk to than you  the cause of my problems my life is garbage and i'm 'bout to take it out on you poof  then i'm gone  voosh  i flee the scene  like it was my last ride you see right through  oh  you had me pegged the first time you can see the truth  but it's easier to justify what's bad is good and i hate to be the bad guy i just hate to be the bad guy follow me i run  i run  follow me  follow me i just hate to be the bad guy  i've been driving around your side of this town like nine fricking hours and forty five minutes now finally i found your new address  park in your drive feel like i've been waiting on this moment all of my life and it's now arrived and my mouth is fulla saliva my knife is out and i'm ducking on the side of your house  see  it's sad it came to this point such a disappointment i had to make this appointment to come and see ya but i ain't here for your empathy  i don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy  it's revenge that i seek  so i sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window like i reach my full potential  i peeked continue to peep  still bent low then keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo  sneak all the way 'round to the back porch man  door handles unlocked  shouldn't be that easy to do this you don't plan for intruders beforehand  surprised to see me  cat got your tongue  gag  chloroform rag  dag almost hacked up a lung like you picked an axe up and swung stick to the core plan  dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans  irony's spectacular  huh  now who's a faggot  you punk  and here's your bronco hat  you can have that shit back 'cause they suck  it's just me  you and the music now  slim i hope you hear it  we're in a car right now wait  here comes my favorite lyric  i'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die  and hey  here's the sequel to my mathers lp just to try to get people to buy  well  how's this for publicity stunt  this should be fun last album now  'cause after this you'll be officially done eminem killed by m and m matthew mitchell  bitch  i even have your initials  i initially was gonna bury you next to my brother  but fuck it since you're in love with your city so much i figured what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here two more exits  time is quite near hope we don't get stopped  no license i fear  that sirens i hear  guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea as cops appear in my driver's side mirror  oh  god  police  ah  hope fox trot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot new plan stan slim  chauvinist pig  drove in this big  lincoln town car  well  gotta go  almost at the bridge  ha ha big bro it's for you slim  this is for him and frank ocean  oh hope you can swim good now say you hate homos again  i also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend i'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in i'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin nope  it's hopeless  i'm the denial that you're hopelessly in when they say all of this is approaching its end but you refuse to believe that it's over  here we go  all over again  back's to the wall  i'm stacking up all them odds  toilets clogged yeah 'cause i'm talking a lotta shit but i'm backing it all up but in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished   i am your lack of a conscience   i'm the ringing in your ears  i'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils eating your vocal chords after your concerts i'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged grab for some water but i'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow  i'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered coming back on ya every woman you insult batter but the double standard you have when it comes to your daughters i represent everything you take for granted 'cause marshall mathers the rappers persona's half a facade and matthew and stan's just symbolic of you not knowing what you have till it's gone 'cause after all the glitz and the glam no more fans that are calling your name cameras are off  sad but it happens to all of them  i'm the hindsight to say  i told you so foreshadows of all the things that are to follow i'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow if you don't stop after they call ya biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits  when it's time to walk away i'm every guilt trip the baggage you have but as you gather up all your possessions if there's anything you have left to say less it makes an impact then don't bother so 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop  so  one last time  i'm back 'fore it fades into black and it's all over behold the final chapter in a saga trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle twice the magic that started it all tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable here goes a wild stab in the dark uh  as we

569,Asshole,i came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain an asshole  that role i think i succeed in fulfilling but don't think i ever stopped to think i was speaking to children everything was happening so fast it was like i blinked  sold three million  then it all went blank  all i remember is feeling ridiculous cause i was getting sick of this feeling like i'm always under attack man i could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling women dish him but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this i would kill him  guess i'm a little bit of a hypocrite when i'm ripping shit  but since when did this many people ever give a shit but i had to say  it's just my opinion if it contradicts how i'm living put a dick in your rear end and guess what every time you mention a lyric  i thank you for it  for drawing more attention toward it cause it gave me an enormous platform of platitude thought i was that important but you can't ignore the fact that i fought for the respect and battle for it  mad awards  act paranoid  attaboy  they told me to slow down and i just zone out good luck trying to convince a blonde that's like telling gwen stefan' that she sold out 'cause i was tryna leave  no doubt in anyone's mind one day i'd go down in history think they know now because everybody knows  everybody knows that you're just an asshole everywhere that you go  people wanna go home  everyone knows everybody knows  so don't pretend to be nice there's no place you can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows  everyone knows  thanks for the support  asshole thanks for the support  asshole  quit acting salty  i was counting on you to count me out as asher roth when he round a bout dissed me to shout me out thought i was history but goddamn  honkey  that compliment's like backhanding a donkey good way to get your ass socked in the mouth lay'em off it  but what the fuck is all this thrash talking about the fight was fixed  i'm back and you can't stop me you knock me down  i went down for the count i fell but the fans caught me  and now you're gonna have to beat the fuckin' pants off me to take my belt  word to pacquiao  mama said there ain't nothing else to talk about gotta go in that ring and knock them out or you better not come out it's poetry in motion  like freddie roach when he's quoting shakespeare so what if the insults are revolting  even helen keller knows life stinks you think it's a joke till you're bullet riddled but you should give little shit what i think this whole world is a mess gotta have a goddamn vest on your chest  and a glock just to go out watch batman  who needs a test to test the testicles  not that man half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage rest of you got lap bands stuck to this model before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in colorado so get lost  waldo  my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping a black hole that i'm swallowing this track whole with a pack torn of paper but i'm not taking no crap  ho here i go down the back pole and i'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there it go trying to dip through the back door retreating 'cause everybody knows  everybody knows that you're just an asshole everywhere that you go  people wanna go home  everyone knows everybody knows  so don't pretend to be nice there's no place you can hide you are just an asshole everyone knows  everyone knows  holy mackerel  i'm the biggest jerk on the planet earth i smack the girl off the mechanical bull  then attract the bull

words you can understandable  it's tragical thinkin' some magical shit's gonna happen  that ain't practical you crackin' a joke  it's laughable  'cause me and love's like a bad combination i keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say i'm uncrackable my heart is truly guarded  full body armor bitch you just need a helmet 'cause if you think you're special  you're retarded  thinkin' you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina you're a train wreck  i got a one track mind shorty you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er 'cause you been a gold digger since you were a minor been tryina hunt me down like a dog  'cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent because all of my spare time is spent  with my nose in this binder  so don't bother tryin' only women that i love are my daughters and sometimes i rhyme and it sounds like i forget i'm a father and i push it farther so father forgive me if i forget to draw the line it's apparent i shouldn't of been a parent i'll never grow up so to hell with your parents and motherfucking father time and it ain't never gonna stop  a pessimist who transforms you to optimus in his prime so even if i'm half dead  i'm
